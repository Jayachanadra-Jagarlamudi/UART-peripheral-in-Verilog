# A full duplex UART peripheral with SECDED ECC scheme and direct memory interfacing

A full duplex UART system(Tx and Rx both) that can send/receive a configurable data word of length 4-8 bits. Hamming code with SECDED ECC scheme is implemented with the variable data packet and a memory interface module is provided to directly read/write from memory with any processor input.
